A quick 5 hour hackathon hosted several companies. Now I hope this helps people with using JSONP to avoid all of that cross origin resourse sharing(CORS) problems that so many people run into.
JSONP is JSON "with padding" takes advantage of the script tag to get around the CORS issues.
This uses Best Buy API to demo using JSONP. 
Go nuts.
